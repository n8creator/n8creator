# Welcome here! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dmitry Volkov, a former Project/Product manager switched to BackEnd Development. I specialize in creating web applications, emphasizing an approach that avoids the use of JavaScript by employing the ***HTML over the wire*** approach (via *HTMX* Library) for better clarity and simplicity.

#### Technologies I Work With:

- BackEnd Languages: Python 3.8+, Go Lang
- Web Frameworks: Django, DRF, FastAPI, Fiber
- API Design: REST, HTML over the wire, DTL (Django Templates)
- Databases: PostgreSQL, TimeScaleDB, Redis, MongoDB, SQLite
- FrontEnd: Bootstrap 5, HTMX, HTML, CSS
- Deployment: Docker & Docker Compose, Ansible, Dokku, Nginx
- Other: PyTest, GitHub Actions, CI/CD

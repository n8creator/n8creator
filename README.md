# Welcome here! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dmitry Volkov, a former Project/Product manager switched to BackEnd Development. I specialize in creating web applications, emphasizing an approach that avoids the use of JavaScript (_Yes, I hate it!_) by employing the __'HTML over the wire'__ approach for better clarity and simplicity.


#### Technologies I Work With:

- BackEnd Languages: Python 3.8+, Go Lang
- Web Frameworks: Django & Django REST (DRF), Fiber
- API Technologies: DTL (Django Templates), HTML over the wire, REST, gRPC
- Databases: PostgreSQL, TimeScale DB, SQLite
- FrontEnd: Bootstrap 5, HTMX, HTML, CSS
- Deployment: Docker & Docker Compose, Ansible, Dokku
- Other: PyTest, GitHub Actions, CI/CD
